### **Hi there!** 👋

I'm **Alfonso**, a Software Engineer based in Costa Rica. I enjoy building projects that involve software and hardware solutions, due to my background in **software engineering**, **electrical engineering**, and **mechanical engineering**. 

Despite I have professional experience in **embedded and aerospace software verification/validation**, my GitHub is focused on **software development**.

**I am currently working on:**

- **C++**, **C** and **Python** Development, in that order.
- Software Engineering.
- Embedded Systems.
